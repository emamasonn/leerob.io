_The year is 2030. Everyone has a newsletter. Email has overtaken social media. 95% of coding is done via drag-and-drop tools._

Okay, most of that probably isn't true. Except the [no-code tools](https://webflow.com/).
Unless you've been living under a rock, you've probably noticed the rise of newsletters (especially in the developer community).

_Why?_ Well, they're an excellent way to promote content to those who really want to read it. If you've ever thought about starting a newsletter, then you've found the right article ðŸŽ‰

## Mailchimp vs. The World

If you're just starting a newsletter, you probably want something with a free tier.
That was my rationale for adopting [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/). It was simple, easy to set up, and didn't require an API route. Perfect!

However, it wasn't exactly a frictionless sign-up process. When a user clicked "subscribe", it launched a pop-up window where they had to confirm their email address again.
Again, _it works_, but we can do better.

I started to explore using [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) as an alternative. It also has a [free tier](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/) if you have less than 2,000 subscribers. Perfect.

## Why Next.js?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the [easiest way](https://masteringnextjs.com/learn-next-js) to build applications in React. One of my favorite features is API routes.

API routes provide a straightforward solution for building an API inside Next.js.
All you need to get started is an `api/` folder inside your main `pages/` folder where your routes live.

Every file inside `pages/api/` is mapped to `/api/*`. This is where we'll communicate with Mailchimp.
First, we need to set up an account.

## Setting up Mailchimp

After [creating an account](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-an-account/), you'll need to fetch your [API key](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/#find+or+generate+your+api+key). You can utilize their [API Playground](https://us1.api.mailchimp.com/playground/?_ga=2.231663199.1180055433.1567349670-195619933.1565803046) to test requests.

When a user clicks "subscribe", we'll want to add their email address to the mailing list. This is through the [List Members POST](https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/lists/members/#create-post_lists_list_id_members) endpoint.

According to their [API documentation](https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/guides/get-started-with-mailchimp-api-3/), we'll need to send a request to:

```bash
https://<dc>.api.mailchimp.com/3.0
```

Where `dc` is the datacenter. This is the last 3 characters of your API key we retrieved earlier. We'll also need to fetch the [Audience ID](https://mailchimp.com/help/find-audience-id/) (or List ID) for the mailing list.

## Environment Variables

Let's make our secrets we've retrieved available without hardcoding them into our request. Since I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I'll need to set up some [environment variables](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/build-step#using-environment-variables-and-secrets).
You can use similar a [similar approach](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables) for [any framework](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/environment-variables/) to add your secrets to `process.env`.

```bash
$ vc secret add MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID <secret-value>
$ vc secret add MAILCHIMP_API_KEY <secret-value>
```

Then, we can expose them via our `vercel.json` file.

```json:vercel.json
{
  "env": {
    "MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID": "@mailchimp-list-id",
    "MAILCHIMP_API_KEY": "@mailchimp-api-key"
  }
}
```

These variables will be available at build time. To test locally, we'll also want to create a `.env` file since Vercel Secrets [aren't available](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets/) locally running `vc dev`.

```bash:.env
MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID=<secret-value>
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=<secret-value>
```

**Note:** Don't forget to add `.env` to your `.gitignore`. We don't want to commit our secrets.

## Creating The Request

Now that we have the API Key and the List ID available as environment variables, we can create an API route at `pages/api/subscribe.js` to add a member to our list.

```js:pages/api/subscribe.js
export default async (req, res) => {
  // 1. Destructure the email address from the request body.
  const { email } = req.body;

  if (!email) {
    // 2. Throw an error if an email wasn't provided.
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email is required' });
  }

  try {
    // 3. Fetch the environment variables.
    const LIST_ID = process.env.MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID;
    const API_KEY = process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_KEY;
    // 4. API keys are in the form <key>-us3.
    const DATACENTER = API_KEY.split('-')[1];

    // 5. The status of 'subscribed' is equivalent to a double opt-in.
    const data = {
      email_address: email,
      status: 'subscribed'
    };

    // 6. Send a POST request to Mailchimp.
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://${DATACENTER}.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/lists/${LIST_ID}/members`,
      {
        body: JSON.stringify(data),
        headers: {
          Authorization: `apikey ${API_KEY}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        method: 'POST'
      }
    );

    // 7. Swallow any errors from Mailchimp and return a better error message.
    if (response.status >= 400) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: `There was an error subscribing to the newsletter. Shoot me an email at [me@leerob.io] and I'll add you to the list.`
      });
    }

    // 8. If we made it this far, it was a success! ðŸŽ‰
    return res.status(201).json({ error: '' });
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message || error.toString() });
  }
};
```

## Creating A Form Input

Now that our API is created, we need a way to gather user input. Let's create a component to send a request to our API.

```js:components/Subscribe.js
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function Subscribe() {
  // 1. Create a reference to the input so we can fetch/clear it's value.
  const inputEl = useRef(null);
  // 2. Hold a message in state to handle the response from our API.
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const subscribe = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    // 3. Send a request to our API with the user's email address.
    const res = await fetch('/api/subscribe', {
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email: inputEl.current.value
      }),
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      method: 'POST'
    });

    const { error } = await res.json();

    if (error) {
      // 4. If there was an error, update the message in state.
      setMessage(error);

      return;
    }

    // 5. Clear the input value and show a success message.
    inputEl.current.value = '';
    setMessage('Success! ðŸŽ‰ You are now subscribed to the newsletter.');
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={subscribe}>
      <label htmlFor="email-input">{'Email Address'}</label>
      <input
        id="email-input"
        name="email"
        placeholder="you@awesome.com"
        ref={inputEl}
        type="email"
      />
      <div>
        {message
          ? message
          : `I'll only send emails when new content is posted. No spam.`}
      </div>
      <button type="submit">{'âœ¨ Subscribe ðŸ’Œ'}</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
